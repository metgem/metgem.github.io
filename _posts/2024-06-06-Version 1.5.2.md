A few additional parameters has been introduced for improved flexibility:
- You can set the mininum *m/z* limit you want to use in the filter section of the Import Data dialog. It was previously fixed to 50 Th.
- Add options in Force Directed views to control scale and gravity
- A title can be added for each view to ease identification of networks.

MetGem can now read MGF file with non-consecutive ids, as output by MZMine especially by the `Processing Wizard`.

The scores matrix can now be sparse, meaning that only score different from zero are stored. This is usefull to work with very large datasets, for which the entire dense matrix cannot be kept in memory.
Note that not all views are compatible with these sparse matrixes (Only Force Directed and t-SNE).

A help link is now present on most of the dialogs for better understanding of the algorithms.

MetGem now includes a command-line executable (`metgem-cli`) to generate network with user interface. It generates a project file that can be later opened by MetGem's user interface.

A large number of bugs have also been fixed. Full changelog can be found in the [release page](https://github.com/metgem/metgem/releases/tag/v1.5.0).
